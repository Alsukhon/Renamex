# Renamex

You can use this script file to change file extensions by renaming the files, not converting them. You need to know the current and the output extensions.

# Must have Python 3.x installed!

How to use:
------------
1. Place this script in the folders with the target files.
2. Run the script
3. Enter the current file extension in "Input Extension"
4. Enter the output file extension you want in "Output Extension"
5. Find your file(s) in the newly created "Renamex" folder!

Please contact me with any issues with the file, any feedback is appreciated!
